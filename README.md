# POD 5 Collaborative GitHub Practice 1

## Introduction

Welcome to our POD 5 GitHub task 1! This task is designed to give you hands-on experience with GitHub, a crucial tool in software development. You will work in the same repository, which does NOT have branch protections to highlight issues you might encounter.

## Objectives

- Familiarize yourself with basic GitHub operations.
- Practice collaborating in a shared repository.
- Understand the importance of communication and best practices in version control.

## Tasks

0. **Post your GitHub Username in POD 5 channel message in slack**
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Add Week 1 Notes**: Create a new file or add to an existing file with notes about the content from the first week of our bootcamp (HTML & a bit of CSS) Commit and push these notes to the repository.
3. **Edit the README**: Add your GitHub username to the Contributors section of this README file with a link to your GitHub profile.
4. **Style with CSS**: If you have HTML files in this repository, add or edit a CSS file to style them. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages.
5. **Review and Edit Code**: Look through the repository for any code or files added by your peers. Feel free to make improvements or suggestions by editing their code or leaving comments.
6. **Encounter and Resolve Conflicts**: Since there are no branch protections, you might encounter merge conflicts. Try to resolve these conflicts on your own or with your peers.
7. **Pull Requests**: Make pull requests to propose your changes. Ensure you describe what you've done in the pull request description.
8. **Code Review**: Review at least one pull request made by a peer and leave constructive feedback.
9. **Reflect and Discuss**: Make use of [Discussions](https://github.com/MartinSWDev/pod-5-week-1-notes/discussions) to work through solutions, make suggestions and help eachother.

## Notes

- All decisions layout and content will be decided by you
- Things will break, do your best to fix them
- Remember to pull the latest changes from the main branch frequently to stay updated.
- Communicate with your peers to avoid overlapping work.
- Keep your commits small and focused on a single task for easier tracking and management.

Good luck, and enjoy your journey with GitHub!
